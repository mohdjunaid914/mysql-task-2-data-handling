# mysql-task-2-data-handling
This repo contains SQL practice for Task 2 using MySQL Workbench. It includes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries on the students, courses, and enrollments tables. The project also covers handling NULL values and checking results through SELECT statements, all in one SQL file.

This project is a small SQL practice task where I worked with three tables: students, courses, and enrollments. These tables were already created earlier, and in this task, I focused only on inserting new data, updating existing data, handling NULL values, and deleting specific records.

The queries were written and executed in MySQL Workbench.

🔥 What This Task Covers
1. Inserting Data

I added new rows to each table.
Some of the values were purposely left as NULL so that I could practice updating them later (like NULL city, NULL duration, and NULL enroll_date).

2. Updating Data

In this step, I updated:

Missing cities in the students table

Missing durations in the courses table

Missing enrollment dates in the enrollments table

This helped me understand how to work with NULL values.

3. Deleting Data

I deleted a few rows based on specific conditions, such as:

Students above a certain age

A particular enrollment record

A course with a specific duration

This was done to practice safely removing records from tables.

4. Checking the Final Output

At the end, I used SELECT queries to view the updated data in all three tables and confirm that everything was applied correctly.
